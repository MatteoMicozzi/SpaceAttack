      <p>
        While most recently I’ve been crafting unique cocktails as a mixologist and supervisor,
        my career has taken me full-circle back to technology. I grew up in a family-owned arcade
        and began coding microprocessors at school, making my first website in 2006 and later
        progressing to an engineering role programming alarm systems. As an enthusiastic learner,
        the pandemic presented an opportunity for me to return to my first and continuing passion
        and I attended the coding bootcamp, Makers.
