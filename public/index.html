      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        While most recently I’ve been crafting unique cocktails as a mixologist and supervisor, my career has taken me full-circle back to technology. I grew up in a family-owned arcade and began coding microprocessors at school, making my first website in 2006 and later progressing to an engineering role programming alarm systems. As an enthusiastic learner, the pandemic presented an opportunity for me to return to my first and continuing passion and I attended the coding bootcamp, Makers.
